###Sum All Numbers in a Range
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers and all numbers between them.
The lowest number will not always come first.  
Completed - SumAllNumbersInARange.js

###Diff Two Arrays
Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, 
but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.  
Completed - DiffTwoArrays.js

###Roman Numeral Converter
Convert the given number into a roman numeral.  
Completed - RomanNumeralConverter.js

###Wherefore art thou
Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of 
all objects that have matching property and value pairs (second argument). Each property and value pair of 
the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.  
Completed - WhereforeArtThou.js

###Search and Replace
Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.
First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.
Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).
Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).
NOTE: Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog"
